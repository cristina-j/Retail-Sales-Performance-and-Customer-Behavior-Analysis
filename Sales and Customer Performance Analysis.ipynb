    "### Question 1: How did total revenue perform compared to the previous year?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are comparing the current year (2016) to the previous year (2015) revenue, total revenue reached \\\\$17M, representing a 11.54\\% decrease year-over-year compared to 2015 where the total revenue was \\\\$20M. \n",
    "\n",
    "Revenue growth diminished in the second half of the year starting in July after the mid-year where there were no sales from July until the reast of the year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite incomplete data for 2016, the upward trend in 2015 suggests a strong sales momentum. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are there no records for Q3 and Q4 in 2014 and 2016?\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset does not contain records for the final five months in 2014 and 2016. Because of this, year-over-year analysis involiving these years should be taken with caution particularly when looking towards the end of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide additional context, external economic conditions during these periods were researched to better understand the broader business environment in which the data exists. This contextual research is used to support interpretation, not to directly explain or seen as an attribute to the missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2014 \n",
    "It looks like businesses experienced slower growth, particularily in Europe which was still trying to recover from prior financial challenges. People were not spending as much especially on non-essential items. And while growth across businesses weresteady, it was not strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2016 \n",
    "In 2016, economic and political uncertainty increased due to events such as the Brexit referendum in Europe and the U.S. presidential election. During periods of uncertainty, consumers often delay larger or discretionary purchases, which can lead to uneven performance across the year for many businesses.\n"

    "\n",
    "As we continue to look at the revenue and compare how much money is being profitted it can be said that there is a correlation between the two. Over the course of 2011 to 2016, when revenue increased or decreased, profit followed in the same trajectory of decreasing or increasing as well. So that means that profits were stable during the periods where revenue increased. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of this is that in 2015 total revenue reached \\\\$20M which was a 41.49\\% increase from the year before. Profit followed the same increase with a total of \\\\$7.5M in profit which was a 28.38\\% increase from the previous year.  "

However, the total orders decreased by 16\\% but the total revenue still took an upward trajectory increasing by 41\\%.
