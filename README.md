# Retail Sales Performance & Customer Behavior Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes retail sales transactions between 2011 and 2016 to evaluate revenue performance, profit trends, and customer purchasing behavior.

The objective was to determine whether revenue growth was driven by increased order volume or higher-value purchases, and how product concentration and demographic contribution influenced overall business performance.

---

## Business Problem
The business wants to better understand:

- How revenue and profit have performed year-over-year
- What is driving revenue and profit growth
- Which products categories drive financial performance 
- How customer purchasing behavior differs across demographic factors

---

## Executive Findings
Key Findings:
- 2015 revenue increased 41% year-over-year
- Order volume declined 16% in the same year
- Average Order Value increased 85%

Revenue growth was driven primarily by larger transactional size rather than increase customer frequency.




## Results & Key Insights

### Sales Performance
- Revenue and profit increased significantly in 2015 despite a decline in total order volume
- Profit growth closely followed revenue growth, suggesting healthy margins
- Revenue gains were concentrated in a small number of high-performing product subcategories

### Customer Behavior
- Total orders declined year-over-year, but Average Order Value (AOV) increased sharply
- Revenue growth was driven by higher-value purchases, not increased order frequency
- Adult and young adult age groups contributed the largest share of revenue
- Revenue distribution across genders remained relatively balanced

## Business Recommendations
Based on the analysis:

- Reinforce strategies that encourage higher transaction value, such as product bundling, accessory add-ons, and premium-tier positioning.
- Monitor pricing elasticity to ensure higher average order value does not suppress long-term customer frequency.
- Protect and optimize top-performing categories through inventory planning and pricing discipline.
- Simultaneously invest in developing mid-tier categories to reduce dependency risk.
- Prioritize targeted campaigns for these age groups using tailored messaging and financing options for high-ticket purchases.
